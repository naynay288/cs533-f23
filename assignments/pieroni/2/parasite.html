<h1>Parasite</h1>
<p>Parasite is a South Korean film by director Bong Joon-ho that blends some of my favorite genres in movies like thriller, suspense, drama, and a little bit of heist/mystery.  At first watch it is a thrilling family drama that turns deadly but can really open your mind to the state of poverty, classism, and social-economic structures within the world.  I genuinely wish I could watch it for the first time as it was such a riveting experience like no other.</p>
<p>P.S. I recommend all of his other movies such as Snowpiercer, Memories of Murder, and The Host.
