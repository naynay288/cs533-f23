        <h1>Zager & Evans - In the Year 2525</h1>
        <p><center>There are too many bands to choose a singular favorite so I decided instead I'd use one of my favorite one-hit wonder songs, titled "In the Year 2525". The song, written in 19, is almost prophetically ahead of its time, touching on science fictions that are becoming all too real and present today such as the gendered and existential dangers looming overhead, the dangers of pharmecutical regulation of the human mind and body, the merger and replacement of man with machine, eugenics and designer babies, and the long march of time into an unknown future.</center></p>
