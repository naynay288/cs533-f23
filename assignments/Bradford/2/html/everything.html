  <h1>Favorite recent movie: Everything, Everywhere, All at Once</h1>
  <p>
    Everything, Everywhere, All at Once is an action comedy about a woman suddenly forced into a multiversal conflict.
    <br>
    It's one of the most ridiculous and heartfelt movies I have ever seen. 
    <br>
    Waymond Wang (the main character's husband) is one of my favorite fictional characters and I love that the climax of the movie hinges on his kindness and non-violence.
