  <h1>Favorite recent TV show: The Bear</h1>
  <p>
    The Bear is a Hulu original show about a world-class chef and his efforts to save his family's restaurant after the death of his brother.
    <br>
    I loved pretty much every performance from the main and supporting cast. That and the writing definitely makes the characters feel like real and relatable people.
    <br>
    The show also has amazing cinematography. One episode (Season 1 Episode 7) was shot entirely in one continuous take and it's one of the most impressive things I've ever seen.
